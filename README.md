# gatorloopdatagenerator

1. clone it
2. go install
3. gatorloopdatagenerator
	- this will add semi-real looking data to the database so you can test out the front-end
4. gatorloopdatagenerator cleanup
	- this will clear all the data out of all the gatorloop schema tables


So if you run this while you're requesting data on the front-end, you'll get constantly changing data which is nice for simulating the real thing.
